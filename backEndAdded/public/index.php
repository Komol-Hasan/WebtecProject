                            Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person - the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components - red cells, platelets and plasma - which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.

                            <h4>Is donating blood safe?</h4>
                            Absolutely. Blood donation conditions are sanitary, and needles are sterile and disposable.
                            <br/>
                            <h4>Who can give blood?</h4>
                            Almost anyone who is healthy, at least 16 years old, and weighs at least 110 pounds. (16-year-olds must weigh at least 130 lbs and need signed parental consent.) Learn more specifics at our <a href="http://www.thebloodcenter.org/donor/Deferrals.aspx">Deferral Guidelines</a> page.

                            <h4>How much blood is drawn? Is it safe for my body to lose that much blood?</h4>
                            One pint. The average person has 10-12 pints, so the small loss is easily afforded. The fluid (plasma) is replaced within 24 hours. The red cells take about five weeks. You can donate again in eight weeks!
